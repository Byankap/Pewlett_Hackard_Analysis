# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

### Overview of the analysis
As a company of more than seven thousand employees, Pewlett Hackard wants a forecast of the future positions it will need to be filled once a large number of employees retire in the near future; as well as, determining a mentorship program to smooth out the process.   
## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
There are two managers on the retiring_titles.
There is a larger number of retirement-ready employees than retirees who are eligible for mentoring the next generation.
We need further knowledge on the type of staff that will be replaced.
Create new tables to determine retiring titles based on department.

## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
There are 1,941 individuals whom are eligible to participate in the program. Since there are 41,381 individuals who will be retiring, at least filling 1000 roles would make an impact. 

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
There are not enough qualified to mentor the next generation. However, by creating training videos that can reused can replace the need of an individual teaching the class. Retirement-ready employees can focus and mentor individuals onsite.
